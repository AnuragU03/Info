## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy orange (#D2691E) evoking the warmth and groundedness of rural landscapes.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a soft, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Forest green (#228B22), symbolizing nature and sustainability.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, providing elegance, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, offering readability.
- Use line icons with rounded corners, in a stroke width slightly heavier than the defaults, to enhance visibility on mobile devices; icons should represent nature and local crafts, reflecting the unique character of the village.
- Mobile-first layout with clear, readable content blocks and prominent calls to action.
- Subtle, nature-inspired transitions and animations.
